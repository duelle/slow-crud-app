slow-crud-app
=============

slow-crud-app is a 'typical' Web CRUD App using Spring, Hibernate and other 'typical' enterprise Java technologies. 
It's key purpose is to provide configurable bad performance characteristics through JMX, such as Deadlocks, heavy 
Disk I/O, heavy Network I/O, CPU trashing etc.

slow-crud-app can be used for testing performance theories, teaching, performance tuning workshops etc.

slow-crud-app is a fake application which hosts job listings for people who only had one job (onlyhadonejob.com).

Disclaimer
==========

This project is not truly a 'real world' application. It is an experimental project with the goal of providing a 
pluggable framework in which to add different performance scenarios such as Deadlocks, waiting on 3rd party resources, 
Garbage Collection pauses, Disk I/O and much, much more.

There is deliberately badly performing code in slow-crud-app, please do ask on the Friends of jClarity mailing list first!

How to help
===========

Development of slow-crud-app is currently discussed through the "Friends of jClarity" community mailing list. You can sign-up

Bad Performance Characteristics
===============================

The following performance characteristics have been implemented:

* Waiting on 3rd party resource (RESTFul call)
* CPU Bound code
* Too much logging and Disk I/O
* Too much context switching
* Lock contention problems
* Deadlock

Building slow-crud-app
=====================

slow-crud-app is a Maven 3 project

```mvn clean install```

Running slow-crud-app
=====================
   
slow-crud-app is a jetty plugin enabled Maven 3 project and will start on localhost:8080/had_one_dismissal

```
cd had-one-dismisaal
mvn jetty:run
```

Also, you'll want to bring up the 3rd party service

```
cd auth-service
mvn jetty:run

Running Performance Tests
=========================

If you want to run the performance testing suite then you need the harness to point to the server running
both of these.  So you might want to do something like this:

```
cd had-one-dismisaal
mvn jetty:run
```

```
cd auth-service
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1100 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"```
mvn -Djetty.port=9000 jetty:run
```
```
cd sca-test-harness
mvn -Djclarity.hod.host=localhost -DJMX_AUTH_SERVER_HOST=localhost -DJMX_AUTH_SERVER_PORT=1100 -DmainClass=com.jclarity.had_one_dismissal.Main -Darguments="-f src/main/resources/exercises.csv" exec:java
```

The exercises are customisable via a csv file.  See `src/main/resources/` for details.
